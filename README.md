## TL;DR
- Web3 has been trending since the start of 2022, much like NFTs were exploding last year.
- Prior experience in Solidity and Blockchain Development tools like Ganache, Truffle etc., is not required.
- A DApp is a software application that operates on a distributed network.
- We need to install VS Code, NodeJS, Git, Truffle and Ganache.
- After that, we will set up our development environment using the Truffle Box, i.e. pet-shop.
- The next step is to create a smart contract using solidity.
- We will compile the smart contract using the truffle compile command and then migrate it using the truffle migrate command.
- We will create a TestAdoption.sol file to test our smart contract along with the truffle test command.
- We will create a user interface with Web3.js and some existing code in the truffle box.
- Finally, we will interact with our DApp using MetaMask and Ganache.
